        <p class = "intro"> The <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard"> briard</a>, or berger die brie, is a large breed of dogs.</p>
        <h3>Breed history</h3>
        <p>
            The Briard originated in, and is named for, the Brie historic region of north-central France, 
            where it was traditionally used both for herding sheep and to defend them.
            The first written mention of the shepherd dogs of Brie is thought to be in 
            the Cours complet d'agriculture of Jean-Baptiste François Rozier, who in 1783 wrote that the "chien de Brie" 
            was long-haired and usually black;that in the open plains there was little danger from wolves, 
            and so the dogs were used more for herding than for defence;and that shepherd dogs had the task of 
            preventing the sheep from straying into crops or vineyards where they might cause damage.
            In 1896, Mégnin was among those who founded the Club des chiens de berger français.
            The Berger de Brie was first shown at the first Paris dog show in 1863, where a bitch named Charmant took a prize. 
            The first Briard to be registered in the Livre des Origines Françaises , the national stud-book for dogs, 
            was Sans Gêne, winner of a gold medal at the Paris show in 1885.A breed standard was drawn up in 1897, 
            in which two varieties were described: one with a woolly or sheep-like coat, the other with a coat more 
            similar to that of the goat; the woolly type later disappeared. In 1909 a breed society, Les Amis du Briard, 
            was formed.
